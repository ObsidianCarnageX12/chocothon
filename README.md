# Chocothon

Chocothon aims to be an accurate reproduction of the original Macintosh version of the Marathon trilogy, analogous to [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom).

Chocothon is based on the [Marathon Infinity source code](http://infinitysource.bungie.org/) release.

# Building

Build the code by running `cmake` with the root directory of the project as the source location, and then building the result with your preferred toolchain.
